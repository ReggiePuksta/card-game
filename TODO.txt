Application initialisation procedure:
    - Load index.html and it's css.
    - Check if user has stored session (logged in).
        If user is logged in we show "Players menu" template
        If user is not logged in we show "Main menu" template
    - Load core Templates first
    - Load the Router
    Create Routing.js for the following pages:
        1) Main menu (no session, initial load page)
        2) Players menu (with session, initial load page)
        3) Deck Builder (with session, loaded from the "Players menu")
        3) Game (with session, loaded from the "Players menu", if the deck is set)
    When router chooses the page it initiates the required page template.
